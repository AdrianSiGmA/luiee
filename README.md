# How to use the package #

## 1. command: roscore ##
## 2. command: rosrun luiee color_detection_1s_node.py ##
## 3. command: rosrun luiee gui_node_adrian.py ##

If you want to see how to interact with the topics, buttons, and text data, just check the other codes in the scripts directory. A lot of improvements can be done in this repo, but this is an already 100% functional GUI for a space demo mission. 

The python code is a bit messy, but if you need some help, just contact me: adricort.unam@gmail.com

Have fun!
